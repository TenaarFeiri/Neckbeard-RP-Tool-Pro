## RP Tool Pro Changelog r20003


Charhandler changes:
    - Updated backups system to new format allowing the usage of bigger save slots. Backwards compatibility will convert old cards to current format. (May need to edit slightly after loading.)

    - Removed a bunch of obsolete functions from the charhandler.

    - Updated several variables in the charhandler to utilize predefined globals instead of locals.

    - Did some minor cleanup on charhandler code.

    - Updated novalue/empty var from "null" to "nil". Charhandler should recursively change that for old cards. Not that it's necessary; it just helps the script identify novalues more easily.


Titler changes:

    - Updated titler script to reflect novalue change from "null" to "nil".

    - Fixed issue where "hide" wouldn't properly remove the OOC and AFK message.

    - Began adding support for the use of tags to different effects. First implementation: "$p" for newline; "$n" for togglenames.

    - Upgraded comma functionality to be toggleable. Toggles between separate line 1 & line 2, merge line 1 & 2 with comma, & merge line 1 and 2 without comma.
