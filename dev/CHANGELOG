## RP Tool Pro Changelog r20003

- Updated backups system to new format allowing the usage of bigger save slots. Backwards compatibility will convert old cards to current format. (May need to edit slightly after loading.)

- Removed a bunch of obsolete functions from the charhandler.

- Updated several variables in the charhandler to utilize predefined globals instead of locals.

- Did some minor cleanup on charhandler code.

- Updated novalue/empty var from "null" to "nil". Charhandler should recursively change that for old cards. Not that it's necessary; it just helps the script identify novalues more easily.

- Updated titler script to reflect novalue change from "null" to "nil".
